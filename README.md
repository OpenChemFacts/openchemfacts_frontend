# OpenChemFacts Frontend

User interface for the OpenChemFacts platform - Visualization and analysis of ecotoxicity data.

## About the project

This interface was co-developed via the Lovable platform. The frontend can be hosted on OVH (current host for the openchemfacts.com domain name and email).

## Installation and local development

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 18 or higher) - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
- **npm** (included with Node.js)

### Installation

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone <REPOSITORY_URL>
cd openchemfacts_frontend

# Step 2: Install dependencies (secure mode)
npm ci --ignore-scripts

# Step 3: Start the development server
npm run dev
```

**⚠️ Security Note**: Since the Shai-Hulud 2.0 attack (November 2025), the project enforces strict dependency installation policies. Always use `npm ci --ignore-scripts` instead of `npm install` to prevent execution of third-party scripts during installation.

The development server will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080` (or another port if 8080 is occupied).
